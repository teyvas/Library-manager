# Project Title: Library Management System
Description:
The Library Management System is a software application designed to manage a collection of books in a library. It allows users to add new books, update existing book details, remove books, display all books, and save the library data to a file. Additionally, the system can load book data from a file when it starts, ensuring that the library collection is preserved between sessions.<br>
***
# Objectives:
* Efficient Book Management: Provide functionalities to add, update, remove, and display books in the library.
* Persistent Storage: Implement mechanisms to save the library data to a file and load it from a file, ensuring data persistence across multiple sessions.
* User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple and intuitive text-based interface for users to interact with the system.
* Error Handling: Handle common errors gracefully, such as attempting to update or remove a book that does not exist.<br>\

# Usage Instructions:
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, for example: g++ -o library_management library_management.cpp.
2. Run the program: ./library_management.
3. Interact with the menu to manage the library by adding, updating, removing, displaying, and saving books.
4. Exit the program by selecting option 6 from the menu.
*Ensure that library.txt exists in the same directory to load the library data on start. The file will also be used to save the library data.*
